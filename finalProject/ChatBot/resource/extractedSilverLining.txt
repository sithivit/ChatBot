[man] "What, are you kidding me? Sundays?
I love Sundays. I live for Sundays.
The whole family's together. Mom makes braciole.
Dad puts the jersey on. We're all watching the game.
Yeah, it drives me crazy, and yes, I was negative.
You didn't even know that I loved it, Nikki, but I did.
- I just didn't appreciate it, or you, before." - [knocking on door]
[man] Come on. Time to go.
"I lost all that. I blew it. But you also blew it.
But we can get it back. We're gonna get it back. It's all gonna be better now.
I'm better now and I hope you are too. And I'm gonna appreciate..."
- [knocking] - I'll be there in a minute, OK?
[man] Doctor's waiting. Let's go!
I'll be there in a minute.
[sighs] "That's true love."
[man] Yeah, that's when I had long hair.
People say I talk about my hair too much.
And it was just the way I want it, but he cut it back too far.
He cut this side back too far trying to even it up.
I didn't tell him to do that. I said, "Just cut it the way..."
[man 2] Once you get in the right frame of mind, I think anything's possible.
I think we so often get caught in this state of negativity
and it's a poison like nothing else.
Technically, you can take him out against our recommendation,
but you assume a lot of liability in the eyes of the court.
And he's just getting used to the routine here.
I don't want him to get used to the routine here.
Eight months is already long enough.
Hey, Mom.
Can we give Danny a ride to North Philly?
What? I don't understand.
Mom, no, it'll be fine. It'll be fine.
I guess everybody's leaving today!
Hello Mrs. S. An honor to finally meet you.
Pat told me all about you, how God made you rich in character,
and you're the mighty oak that hold the household together,
and not to mention the lasagna you make on game day when the birds play.
Danny was in for assault because of crystal meth and alcohol.
- Bad combination. - Yeah. On top of an anxiety disorder.
That's when I was an X-ray technician and... and I...
...my ADD and my anxiety, I had a lot of access
to medication and I took advantage of it.
That's when my hair was long, too.
But my hair only grew
when I was older 'cause when I was younger,
my hair didn't grow because my brother...
Remember I told you about my brother, he had a Jheri curl
and I couldn't get a Jheri curl because my hair didn't grow long...
- [phone ringing] - He's obsessed with his hair.
I was so jealous of my brother...
- Wait a minute. - Hello?
- Yeah, it looks great now. - You like it?
No, it's good now.
Wait, man, you're going the wrong way.
- [Danny] It's this way. - What?
Are you sure about that?
I'll bring him back right away.
You lied to me, Pat. Danny's not allowed to leave.
All right, Mom, just hold on a sec. Let's just talk about this.
- Mom, just listen... - [car horns blaring]
Don't touch the steering wheel!
Pat, this whole thing was a mistake.
I'm sorry, Mom. You OK?
I am out on a limb for you with the courts right now.
It's my fault. Pat didn't know. Pat didn't know.
He's my friend, so he's rooting for me.
I'm having a disagreement with the hospital, but we're working it out.
Take me back to the hospital, but take Pat home, he's fine.
Trust me. You'll see, he's fine. It's my fault.
Mom, could we stop at the library? I wanna read Nikki's
entire English high school syllabus.
Mom, it's a good thing. I'm remaking myself.
[man 1] DeSean Jackson. What happened to DeSean Jackson?
Come on, tell me that one.
It's insanity. He spikes the ball at the one-yard line.
The one-fucking-yard line.
I mean, get into the end zone, dummy.
I mean, he celebrates before he's even in.
You know something? It's nothing new.
Your team does that all the time.
They get close and then they blow it.
They've got an inferiority complex.
Wait a minute. What are you talking about?
What makes the Cowboys America's Team?
Because we are, we're America's Team.
You should be with us, with Philadelphia,
what's the matter with you? You're a fucking traitor.
What's more American than a cowboy?
- You know what's more American? - What?
Benjamin Franklin, that's what's more American.
- Benjamin Franklin? - Benjamin Franklin.
The founder of our country, Philadelphia.
[man 1] With the little glasses and long scraggly hair?
[man 2] What about the lightning with the kite?
He stood in a storm with a kite.
[man 1] If he wasn't on the $100 bill,
nobody would even know who he is.
- [man 1] Why you got so many of these things? - [man 2] Don't touch them.
[man 1] I didn't even touch them. Don't blame me.
Who did this? Who took the remotes like this?
- Did you do this, Randy? - [Randy] No, I don't touch them.
As a matter of fact, I don't know why you need so many.
Hey! Ah! There she is!
Look how beautiful!
What? What's this?
- Everything good? - Mm-hmm.
Ah.
- Where is it? - It's right here.
You got it. Well, we got that.
We don't want them to steal that.
- You still got yours? - Yeah, I got mine.
So, you don't talk to me?
You didn't tell me you took him out?
Well, he's ready. Look at him.
You didn't tell Dad you were picking me up?
Don't worry about that.
I wanna make sure when you come out that you're OK,
and she didn't say anything. You didn't tell me.
The court said yes. Don't worry.
Yeah, but what did the doctor say?
Because the court listens to the doctor.
- Yeah, and the court said... - The court listens to the doctor.
Dad, Dad... Relax.
The court said it's fine, OK? Let it go.
Yeah. Don't worry.
Dad, I'm in there because of the court.
That's the agreement that we made months ago.
It was a plea bargain with the courts.
The lawyer he instructed, he said we should plead that,
and then I would serve eight months and then I'd get out.
[mother] It's all under control.
Well... OK, OK. Congratulations.
Thank you. So what are you doing with yourself?
You know, I'm gonna start a restaurant.
It's gonna be a cheesesteak place.
[Pat] How you gonna pay for it?
I'm gonna pay for it, don't worry about it.
From your bookmaking?
- Who told you that? - Mom told me. Outside.
- I did not. No, I didn't. - You just told me outside, Mom.
What are you talking about? Five minutes ago, we were walking up the stairs, you said,
"Don't say anything, but Dad lost his job and he's bookmaking."
Why? Why, Dolores? Why did you say that to him?
He has the wrong idea. Everything is fine, Patrick.
I'm more concerned about you than anything else.
- Good, Dad. Good. - OK, the question, the big question is
what are you gonna do with yourself?
What am I doing? I'm getting in shape.
I'm getting trim, I'm getting really fit for Nikki.
I'm gonna read Nikki's teaching syllabus and get my old job back.
[stammering] Nikki sold the house. She left.
- Didn't your mother tell you? - Let me tell you something.
You don't know anything about my marriage, OK, Dad? All right?
[stammers] Our marriage, we're very, very much in love, OK?
Just like you two.
Listen, Patrick... she's gone.
She's not around anymore. Nikki left.
What are you doing, Dad? Excelsior.
- Excelsior. Excelsior. - [father] What does that mean?
It means you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna take all this negativity
and I'm gonna use it as fuel, and I'm gonna find a silver lining,
that's what I'm gonna do. And that's no bullshit.
That's no bullshit. That takes work and that's the truth.
What the fuck?!
Stupid fucking book!
I just can't believe Nikki's teaching that book to the kids.
I mean, the whole time, let me just break it down for you.
The whole time, you're rooting for this Hemingway guy to survive the war
and to be with the woman that he loves, Catherine Barkley.
It's 4:00 in the morning, Pat.
And he does. He does. He survives the war.
After getting blown up, he survives it,
and he escapes to Switzerland with Catherine.
But now Catherine's pregnant. Isn't that wonderful? She's pregnant.
And they escape up into the mountains and they're gonna be happy,
and they're gonna be drinking wine and they dance.
They both like to dance with each other. There's scenes of them dancing,
which was boring, but I liked it, because they were happy.
You think he ends it there? No!
He writes another ending. She dies, Dad.
I mean, the world's hard enough as it is, guys.
It's fucking hard enough as it is.
Can't somebody say, "Hey, let's be positive?
Let's have a good ending to the story?"
Pat, you owe us an apology.
Mom, I can't apologize. I'm not gonna apologize for this.
You know what I will do? I will apologize on behalf of Ernest Hemingway,
because that's who's to blame here.
Yeah, have Ernest Hemingway call us and apologize to us, too.
- Why didn't you run with me, huh? - I was reading.
Oh, please. Do us a favor, don't read for a while.
- What're you wearing a garbage bag for? - [grunting] Gonna go run now.
Wait. Wait, wait, wait. You have to fix this window.
- I'll fix it when I get back. - Fix it now.
Get in the car, Pat. You have to go to therapy.
- I don't wanna go to therapy. - You have to go. It's part of the deal.
You can't live with us and not go.
