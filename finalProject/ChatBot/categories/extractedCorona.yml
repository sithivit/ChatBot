- - What happens if you get infected with the coronavirus
  - This looks like a very mild disease like a common cold in the majority of people There are certain people who get infected and have very serious illness among them are health workers Its a very serious infection in them as they get a higher dose than normal people and at the same time they have no immunity So in the general population its likely that the dose of virus that you receive when you are infected is much less than the dose that a health worker would receive health workers having more serious infections So your infection would be less serious hopefully So that leaves the elderly and those with comorbidities to really be the ones that we have to make sure are taken care of in hospitals

- - Who are the people who should be most concerned about this
  - Well the most concerned are people who are first of all in developing countries and who dont have access to good medical care and may not have access at all to a hospital should an epidemic occur in their country Those people would be at great risk especially the elderly Elderly in all populations are at risk but especially those who cant get to oxygen In industrialized countries its the very elderly who have comorbidities who have diabetes who have other diseases who are at risk The general population doesnt appear to be at great risk
- - Who should be the most careful about this disease
  - Well the most concerned are people who are first of all in developing countries and who dont have access to good medical care and may not have access at all to a hospital should an epidemic occur in their country Those people would be at great risk especially the elderly Elderly in all populations are at risk but especially those who cant get to oxygen In industrialized countries its the very elderly who have comorbidities who have diabetes who have other diseases who are at risk The general population doesnt appear to be at great risk
- - What preexisting medical conditions put people at higher risk
  - First of all pulmonary disease existing as a comorbidity is also important In general the elderly are at greater risk especially those over  because their immune systems are not as effective as they might have once been and they are more susceptible to infections In addition in some instances in China theres been a coinfection with influenza and at the same time there have been some bacterial superinfections on the pneumonias that are occurring
- - Where can we find uptodate information
  - The Center for Disease Control in Atlanta keeps track and has updates on a regular basis on its website Also the World Health Organization in Geneva which is coordinating many of the activities going on internationally also has a website with daily updates Its our responsibility to get that information as individuals so we understand and can make sure that we can contribute in our own way to prevention of major spread
- - You led the global response to the SARS outbreak in  How does this outbreak compare
  - Thats the same problem with all new infections This is an infection thats coming to humans who have never been exposed to this virus before They dont have any antibody protection and its not clear whether their immune system can handle this virus or not This is a virus that usually finds itself in bats or in other animals and all of a sudden its in humans And humans just dont have experience with this virus But gradually we are beginning to learn a lot as we did with SARS And you know there are certainly a larger number of deaths than there were with SARS But when you divide that by a denominator of persons who are infected there are many many more persons infected than there were with SARS The case fatality ratio that is the ratio of deaths to the numbers of cases in SARS was about  percent With the current coronavirus COVID it is two percent or probably less So its a much less virulent virus but its still a virus that causes mortality and thats what we dont want entering human populations
- - Have we responded adequately at border crossings such as airports
  - Its clearly understood that airports or any land borders cannot prevent a disease from entering People in the incubation period can cross that border can enter countries and can then infect others when they become sick So borders are not a means of preventing infections from entering a country by checking temperatures Borders are important because you can provide to people arriving from areas that might be at risk of having had infection provide them with an understanding either a printed understanding or a verbal understanding of what the signs and symptoms are of this infection and what they should do if they feel that they might be infected
- - Whats the timeline for a vaccine
  - Vaccines are under development right now theres a lot of research going on That research requires first that the vaccine be developed then that it be studied for safety and effectiveness in animals who are challenged with the virus after they are vaccinated and then it must go into human studies The animal studies have not yet begun but will soon begin for certain vaccines And its thought that by the end of the year or early next year there may be some candidate vaccines that can then be studied for licensing by regulatory agencies So were talking about at least a year until theres vaccine available that can be used in many populations
- - What questions about the outbreak are still unanswered
  - Its clear we know how it transmits we dont know how easily it transmits in humans in communities or in unenclosed areas We know for example that in the enclosed area of a cruise ship it spread very easily We need to better understand how it will spread once it gets into more open areas where people are exposed to people who might be sick
- - What about the global response could be improved
  - A major problem in the world today is that we look at outbreaks in developing countries as something that we need to go and stop So when theres an outbreak of Ebola we think How can we go and stop this outbreak in the country We dont think about How can we help that country strengthen its capacity so that it can detect and respond to infections So we havent invested enough in helping countries develop their core capacity in public health What weve done is invested in many mechanisms globally which can provide support to other countries to go and help stop outbreaks But we want to see a world where every country can do its best to stop its own outbreaks
- - Will we see more emerging disease outbreaks in the future
  - Today there are over seven billion people And when those people come into the world they demand more food they demand a whole series of things and they live closer together In fact were an urban world where people live in urban areas And at the same time were growing more animals and those animals are contributing food to humans as well So what we see is that that animalhuman interface is becoming closer and closer together And this intensive agriculture of animals and this intensive increase in human populations living together on the same planet is really a melting pot where outbreaks can occur and do occur We will eventually have more and more of these outbreaks So an emerging infection today is just a warning of what will happen in the future We have to make sure that that technical collaboration in the world is there to work together to make sure that we can understand these outbreaks when they occur and rapidly provide the information necessary to control them
- - Is the worst behind us
  - I cant predict with accuracy So all I can say is that we must all be prepared for the worstcase scenario And at the same time learn how we can protect ourselves and protect others should we become a part of that epidemic
